# The Tartarus Campaign: A Test of Faith

As Captain of the Blood Ravens' 3rd Company, I led our forces on the forsaken world of Tartarus. This campaign tested not only our martial prowess but also our faith and resolve.

## The Ork Menace

Our primary objective was to stall an unstoppable Ork invasion long enough to evacuate Imperial citizens. The greenskins' ferocity was matched only by their numbers, but the Emperor's finest stood firm against the xenos tide.

## The Alpha Legion's Treachery

Amidst the chaos of battle, we uncovered a more insidious threat. The Alpha Legion, led by the Chaos Lord Bale and the sorcerer Sindri Myr, sought an ancient artifact of Chaos Undivided - the Maledictum.

## A Brother's Betrayal

It pains me to recount, but it was on Tartarus that my dear friend and our Chapter's Librarian, Isador Akios, fell to the corrupting whispers of Chaos. With a heavy heart, I was forced to execute him for his heresy.

## The Maledictum

In the campaign's climax, I confronted Sindri Myr, who had used the Maledictum to transform into a Daemon Prince. With the aid of the Daemonhammer _Godsplitter_, gifted to me by Inquisitor Mordecai Toth, I vanquished the abomination.

## A Pyrrhic Victory

Believing I could end the Chaos threat once and for all, I destroyed the Maledictum. However, this action inadvertently released a Greater Daemon of Khorne. The Aeldari Farseer Macha had warned against this, but in my zeal, I did not heed her words.

The Tartarus Campaign was a crucible that forged me into a stronger leader, but at great cost. It taught me valuable lessons about the insidious nature of Chaos and the importance of considering all counsel, even from xenos allies.

Knowledge is power, guard it well.
