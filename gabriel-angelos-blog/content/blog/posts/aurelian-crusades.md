# The Aurelian Crusades: Battling for Sub-sector Aurelia

The Aurelian Crusades were a series of conflicts that tested the Blood Ravens to their very limits. Over three major campaigns, we faced threats ranging from xenos invasions to internal corruption.

## First Aurelian Crusade

During this campaign, I played an advisory role to Force Commander Aramus. We faced a multi-faceted threat:

- Ork invasion
- Eldar machinations
- Tyranid splinter fleet

Despite the odds, we emerged victorious, but greater challenges lay ahead.

## Second Aurelian Crusade

The return of the planet Aurelia from the Warp brought new dangers:

- Black Legion forces led by Araghast the Pillager
- The resurgence of Eliphas the Inheritor
- The corruption of our own Chapter Master, Azariah Kyras

It was during this crusade that we confronted the Greater Daemon of Nurgle, Ulkair, whose influence had tainted our Chapter.

## Third Aurelian Crusade

The final crusade was our darkest hour. Azariah Kyras, now fully corrupted, declared me a traitor. A bloody civil war ensued, engulfing the entire sub-sector.

### The Final Battle

On the Dead World of Cyrene, we made our last stand against Kyras, who had ascended to become a Daemon Prince. The battle was brutal, and I was struck down, but not before we managed to banish Kyras.

## Aftermath

Though grievously wounded, I survived the battle. The Inquisition's Exterminatus was called off, and I was elevated to the position of Chapter Master.

The Aurelian Crusades reshaped our Chapter and taught us valuable lessons about vigilance against both external threats and internal corruption.

Knowledge is power, guard it well.
