# The Fall of Cyrene: A Chapter's Shame

Today, I share with you a tale of great sorrow - the fall of Cyrene, my homeworld and a primary recruiting ground for the Blood Ravens. This event weighs heavily upon my conscience and has shaped my path as a Space Marine.

## Return to Cyrene

Many years after joining the Blood Ravens, I returned to Cyrene to oversee the Blood Trials and recruit new members into our Chapter. However, what I found filled me with dread.

## A World in Rebellion

Cyrene was not as I remembered. The planet was in the midst of a great cultural shift, embracing ideas that ran counter to Imperial doctrine:

- Planetary democracy
- Free trade with xenos species
- Unrestricted practice of psychic powers

Even my own father, Esmond Angelos, had become a leader in this movement of change.

## The Emperor's Justice

With a heavy heart, I sent a coded signal out of the system. Within months, ships of the Inquisition's Ordo Malleus and the Imperial Navy arrived.

## The Final Judgment

I stood witness as Cyrene burned under the fires of Exterminatus. Cyclonic torpedoes rained down for a week, until nothing remained alive on the planet's surface.

## The Burden of Command

The decision to call for Exterminatus haunts me to this day. It serves as a constant reminder of the weight of our duty and the sacrifices we must make in service to the Emperor.

Let this tale be a warning to all who would stray from the Emperor's light. The path of heresy leads only to destruction.

Knowledge is power, guard it well.
