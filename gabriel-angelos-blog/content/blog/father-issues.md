# The Emperor Protects, But Who Protects Us from Our Fathers?

Greetings, loyal servants of the Emperor. Today, I, Gabriel Angelos, Chapter Master of the Blood Ravens, wish to address a matter of utmost importance: the trials and tribulations of dealing with one's paternal figure.

## A Father's Expectations

My father, Esmond Angelos, was a respected Planetary Governor of Cyrene. One might think this would prepare him for the glory of having a son ascend to the ranks of the Adeptus Astartes. Alas, it seems nothing is ever good enough for some fathers.

## The "When I Was Your Age" Syndrome

I cannot count the number of times I've had to endure, "When I was your age, I was already governing an entire planet!" Father, I am over 300 years old. When you were my age, you were dead.

## Career Choices

Despite my numerous victories against the enemies of mankind, Father still questions my career path. "Exterminatus? In this economy?" he'd say. As if purging heretics and xenos wasn't a stable career choice in the 41st millennium.

## The Family Reunion Incident

During a brief return to Cyrene, Father had the audacity to ask when I was going to "settle down and give him some grandchildren." I'm a genetically modified superhuman warrior monk, Father. That's not exactly in my job description.

## The Chaos Corruption Debacle

When I discovered that Cyrene had fallen to heresy, including my own father's involvement, his response was, "It's just a phase!" No, Father, consorting with Chaos is not a phase. It's heresy.

## Conclusion

While the Emperor's light guides us through the darkness of the void, it seems even His divine radiance cannot fully illuminate the complex relationship between fathers and sons.

Remember, Battle-Brothers, even in the grim darkness of the far future, some things never change. Fathers will always find ways to question our life choices, no matter how many planets we save or daemons we banish.

Knowledge is power, guard it well. And maybe keep it from your father, lest he find some way to criticize it.
