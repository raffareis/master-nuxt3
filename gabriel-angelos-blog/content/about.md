# Gabriel Angelos

Greetings, I am Gabriel Angelos, current Chapter Master of the Blood Ravens Space Marine Chapter. My journey has been one of duty, sacrifice, and unwavering loyalty to the Emperor of Mankind.

## Early Life and Career

I was born on the planet Cyrene, a world that would later become a source of both pride and deep regret for me. Like many of my Battle-Brothers, I passed the Blood Trials and joined the ranks of the Blood Ravens. Through dedication and valor, I rose to become Captain of the 3rd Company.

## Notable Campaigns

Throughout my service, I have led the Blood Ravens in numerous campaigns against the enemies of the Imperium:

- **Tartarus**: Here, I faced the forces of Chaos and made the difficult decision to execute my childhood friend, Isador Akios, who had fallen to corruption.
- **Rahe's Paradise**: I conducted Blood Trials and encountered the Aeldari, learning valuable lessons about the complex nature of our galaxy.
- **Lorn V**: I worked alongside the Aeldari to combat a Necron threat, showcasing my willingness to make difficult alliances for the greater good.
- **The Aurelian Crusades**: I played a crucial role in defending the Aurelian Sub-sector against various threats, including Tyranids and Chaos forces.

## Chapter Master

After a grueling civil war within our Chapter, I confronted and defeated the corrupted Chapter Master Azariah Kyras. Though grievously wounded, I survived and was elevated to the position of Chapter Master, tasked with rebuilding and leading the Blood Ravens into a new era.

## Personal Traits

I am known for my unwavering faith in the Emperor, tactical acumen, and a willingness to make difficult decisions. I carry the guilt of ordering an Exterminatus on my homeworld, Cyrene, a burden that continues to shape my actions and decisions.

## Wargear

My most notable piece of wargear is the Daemonhammer _God-Splitter_, a relic weapon gifted to me by Inquisitor Mordecai Toth. This formidable weapon has served me well in countless battles against the forces of Chaos.

As Chapter Master, I continue to lead the Blood Ravens, ever vigilant against the myriad threats that face the Imperium of Man. Knowledge is power, guard it well.
